# Okta Workflows How-To: GraphQL queries
##### By [Bryan Barrows](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bbarrows89/)

Okta Workflows is a stellar tool for orchestrating automations and has built-in integrations with a wide variety of services. Workflows also makes it easy to communicate with APIs via the API Connector functionality.

A customer recently asked, _"What if I need to talk to a GraphQL service? Can Okta Workflows do that?"_

**Yes!** In essence, GraphQL is just a text format used in HTTP payloads, so we can leverage Workflows to generate the queries and the HTTP Functions in the API Connector to make the calls.
